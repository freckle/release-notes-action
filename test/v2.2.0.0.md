Should match the v2.2.0.0 version in test/CHANGELOG.md

## [v2.2.0.0](https://github.com/freckle/platform/compare/v2.1.0.20...v2.2.0.0)

- Removed `query.StackTemplate` and `query.StackParameters`

  These are no longer used now that we're Stackctl-based.

NOTE: This is a breaking change and thus a major version bump, but we're
unlikely to be relying on this anywhere, so upgrades should be very safe.
